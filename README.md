*Homing Shotgun Airburst Explosive Boomerang Bubbles!*

The game uses a recursive item system, picking up one item's effects can and will stack with other items already acquired.

## Enemies

The game also features many dangerous enemies, they'll mostly try and swarm you, but if there's too many going down one path some of them may try to sneak through a different route!
Not all enemies are as brave as you are, some of them will even run from you!

## Levels

Randomly generated rooms and levels, all guaranteed* to be clearable!

<sub>*Assuming there is no skill issue</sub>
